# Pylindrome v1.2.0

**Pylindrome** is a Python script that checks whether a **word** or **sentence** contains **palindromes**. With clean separation between word and sentence analysis, this version improves clarity, flexibility, and reusability.

## What's New in v1.2.0

- Separated logic into dedicated functions: `word_check()` and `sentence_check()`
- Cleaner input prompts for word vs sentence detection
- Streamlined output formatting with clearer messages
- Main menu for choosing between word or sentence check
- Infinite loop restructured for better readability and flow

---

## Features

- Checks if a **single word** is a palindrome  
- Detects and lists all **palindromes in a sentence**
- Displays **total count** and a formatted **list**
- Case-insensitive comparisons
- Filters out punctuation at the edges
- Menu-based reruns for continuous input
- Input safety via `pyinputplus` validation

## How It Works

1. **Startup**  
   You're prompted to choose between checking a single word or a sentence.

2. **Input**
   - Word: A single term is tested.
   - Sentence: Each word in the sentence is evaluated.

3. **Processing**
   - Reverses each word to compare it.
   - Ignores case differences.
   - Filters out surrounding punctuation from sentences.

4. **Output**
   - Displays whether the input is a palindrome (for words).
   - Shows the count and list of palindromes (for sentences).

5. **Repeat**
   - You're prompted after each check if you'd like to try again.
